## Sustainability Strategy

Integration of sustainability into long-term business strategy and growth plans is becoming increasingly important. A well defined sustainability strategy enables an organization to devise a road map that considers its stakeholders’ views, is realistic and provides measurable sustainability metrics to track its performance against its stated goals. This creates sustainable value for the company’s stakeholders while improving its bottom line.

We understand the sustainability drivers of our clients’ businesses and leverage these while putting in place well-designed strategies that incorporate a wellaccepted methodology. The process of developing a sustainable strategy is founded on an understanding of an organization’s internal “as is” situation by assessing its baseline systems and compliance record.

Our standard methodology involves: 

1. Identification of top sustainability KPIs for the sector/company

2. Identification of global as well as local benchmark companies whose sustainability KPIs are available in their public reports

3. Assessment of the maturity of our client on these KPIs with respect to the benchmark companies and draw up actionable plans

4. Supporting the client in implementing the plans

## Sustainable Supply Chain

Supply chain sustainability is increasingly being looked at as a key component of corporate sustainability. It is the management of environment, social and economic impacts, and the encouragement of good governance practices across the entire life-cycle of goods and services. The key objectives of supply chain sustainability are to create, protect and provide long-term growth of the environmental, social and economic value for all stakeholders involved in bringing products and services to market. There are several existing supply chain sustainability—related frameworks that companies can leverage in order to make their supply chains more sustainable; these include cross-sectoral frameworks such as the UN Global Compact, SEDEX and Ethical Trading initiative (ETI) as well as more industry-specific guidelines such as the Better Cotton Initiative and REACH.

Indian companies across all major sectors face a multitude of supply chain— related sustainability risks, including energy and water consumption, hazardous waste disposal, child labour and corruption. Managing these risks is critical from both a reputational and a legal perspective. Companies with export operations in Europe and North America can face severe commercial risks due to the perceived adverse environmental and social impacts of their supply chains. The major drivers and challenges for companies to implement sustainable supply chains are presented in the next slide.

We provide industry-specific sustainable supply chain—related solutions. Our solutions are designed to assess the current level of sustainability-related risks faced by clients across their supply chains, identify measures to manage these risks, carry out internal capacity building of sustainable supply chains and work back with suppliers and vendors to improve their sustainability performance. Our solutions are transformative in nature and aid our clients’ progress toward a resilient and responsible supply chain.

## Sustainable Future Proofing

Businesses today face increasing pressures brought about by a slew of nontraditional factors such as climate change, environmental sustainability and social concerns that can significantly impact value chains. These pressures are often formalized through national and international policy by bringing in stringent compliance requirements. Businesses are also facing pressure from more “intelligent and sustainability conscious” consumers and rapid digitization, which is changing the demand for traditional products and services.

Businesses have to find ways to future-proof their operations in order to anticipate and prepare for new challenges facing them through the integration of new solutions within existing business models. This is critical to both the business’ short-term profitability and long-term survival.

Climate change can have a severe impact on the ability of businesses to source raw materials. Its impact can be felt across sectors that rely on agriculture or raw materials, as well as in sectors dealing with energy, as the world moves away from fossil fuels to cleaner sources. Social unrest has already impacted several companies in India — a trend that is likely to increase in the future

The Government’s policies regulating the environmental and social performance are also critical as the rigour of these policies will increase with time, thereby also increasing the costs of non-compliance for businesses. Finally, changes in consumer behaviour and demand patterns along with digitization can render entire companies obsolete. Therefore, businesses must ensure that their products and services evolve with consumer demand, while integrating sustainability concerns within business models to future-proof their operations.

We have developed a unique methodology in helping companies across all major sectors future-proof their operations. The plan evolves around the basic concept of dovetailing sustainability parameters (existing and expected aspects of sustainability) on to the business plan.

## True Valuation

True Value is designed to enable better informed decision-making. It helps companies to create more value for stakeholders and society at large. True Value aims to measure and value the most material aspects of value creation, which are usually hidden or go unmeasured. This information enables companies and external stakeholders to improve decision-making. True Value helps to improve overall value creation of organizations.

True Value is the value created for and perceived by stakeholders through the effective development, preservation and deployment of strategic capabilities in line with the organisation’s stated purpose
