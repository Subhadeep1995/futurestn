## Environmental and Social Evaluation

The global population is expected to reach 9 billion by 2050, and a large chunk of this population explosion will take place in developing countries such as India as economies continue to grow and healthcare continues to improve. Developing countries will, therefore, require substantial amounts of investment in their infrastructure to meet the needs of their growing populations. Besides public sector and private sector investment, which can at times be sporadic, this growth in infrastructure will also need to be funded through bilateral and multilateral funds. The World Bank Group and other Development Finance Institutions (DFIs) provided significant amount of official development finance (ODF) for infrastructure development in developing countries including India. It is primarily targeted at reducing the gap between current infrastructure investment and the forecasted infrastructure investment needed across critical sectors such as energy, water and sanitation, transport and communications.

The flow of finance from outside India is often accompanied by stringent Environmental and Social Management System (ESMS )requirements, which are a set of actions and procedures that are implemented concurrently with existing risk management procedures. Several DFIs provide loans for infrastructure development through Indian commercial banks and NBFCs. **However, these loans come with stringent ESMS requirements, which can be quite challenging for both the banks/NBFCs as well as their clients who must comply with ESMS requirements.**

ESMS requirements generally are IFC Performance Standards and WBGâ€™s environmental, health and safety (EHS) guidelines, along with existing national and state-level statutory requirements.
We provide solutions related to ESMS compliance to companies in several sectors. Our approach to executing these engagements is illustrated below:

## Project Monitoring and Evaluation

Several projects are primarily funded by bilateral or multilateral funds such as the World Bank, ADB, the European Commission, USAID, UNDP and UNEP. Monitoring and evaluating the success of these projects can be quite challenging, especially from a non-financial perspective. Monitoring is the regular or routine measurement of the progress of a program/project focusing on project implementation and tracking progress toward a predetermined set of objectives. Evaluation is a periodic assessment of the efficiency, effectiveness, impact, sustainability and relevance of an operation in the context of the stated objectives. Evaluation is usually undertaken as an independent examination of the background, objectives, results, activities and means deployed, with a view to drawing lessons that may guide future decision-making. It is a systemic search for answers concerning the design, implementation and effectiveness of a project or program. Effective Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) is critical to the success of large-scale sustainability and development projects, especially given the socio-economic volatility in India. This is especially true for multi-year projects, which are often questioned about their effectiveness and relevance and are often bogged down due to ineffectual M&E. Effective M&E leads to better measurement, monitoring and management of project results. It also helps donors ensure the achievement of over-arching development objectives such as the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) over and above the individual project objectives. For community-based organizations (CBOs) and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that are responsible for the implementation of large project, a strong focus on M&E along with better governance can help attract even greater aid/loan flows.

We provide M&E services during which we carry out evaluations of existing programs/projects through stakeholder consultations, data review, site visits and the development of a logical framework. Out approach is summarized below:
