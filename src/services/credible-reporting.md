## Integrated Reporting

On 6 February 2017, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) released a circular advising the Top 500 listed entities in India to adhere to integrated reporting (IR) on a voluntary basis from the financial year ending 31st March 2018. We support our clients in developing Integrated Reports

### An increasing need from investors for more information 

Over the past four decades, reporting has evolved in response to organizations’ focus on addressing investors’ demand for more information. However, despite this evolution, research indicates that investors believe disclosure shortfalls remain, especially in the reporting of strategy, risks and future performance. Also, non-financial information, which is often disclosed in different ways, is not easily comparable between organizations. The need for more information related to Environmental and Social Governance (ESG) was never in such demand earlier.

Investors agree that ESG aspects present risks and opportunities that have been neglected for too long and also assert that sustainable returns require a sharper focus on corporate governance, environmental and social considerations. The importance of disclosure and scrutiny of non-financial information is set to grow in the years ahead. There is a growing belief among investors about recent environmental and social scandals driving a need to re-evaluate non-financial disclosures and the information already available. Investors believe the biggest motivator for companies to report ESG information is its potential to impact companies’ reputation among their customers and regulators.

### A new concept of value

 Over time, the market value of organizations has slowly and gradually shifted from one that was based largely on tangible assets to one that puts a greater emphasis on intangible assets. This reflects a fundamental change in how value is being defined and perceived. Many progressive companies today have a market capitalization that is in multiples of the actual value that is reflected on their balance sheet. Having said that, investors and analysts continue to struggle to find a sustainable correlation between past performance, value reflected on the balance sheet, risks and opportunities, future prospects and the market capitalization of companies.

### The genesis of IR 

The global economic crisis that began in early 2008 severely impacted investor confidence, creating a need that saw the eventual setting up of the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC) in 2010, with a focus on improving the confidence of investors. The reporting framework that the IIRC created seeks to provide investors with information that is material to their decision making process. Ultimately, an integrated report should explain the reporting entity’s interrelated financial, environmental, social and corporate governance information. It should be presented in a clear, concise, consistent and comparable manner. And disclosure should be retrospective and prospective to better match investors’ needs. By doing so, organizations could improve their ability to access capital.

### __The key components of an integrated report are__

### The business model 

The definition of the business model lies at the heart of the integrated report. It defines the essence of the organization and maps out the processes by which sustainable value is created.

### The multiple capitals model 

The IIRC has identified six forms of capital: Natural, social and relationship, human, intellectual, manufactured and financial. IR aims to track how the various capitals are used, how they relate to each other and the trade-offs the organization makes. The business model and strategy articulate how capitals will translate into value creation and can be measured by the use of key performance indicators.

## Business Responsibility Reporting

The Ministry of Corporate Affairs of the Government of India has notified the National Voluntary Guidelines for Business Responsibility, which are based on nine principles: business ethics, product responsibility, well-being of employees, stakeholder engagement, human rights, environment, public policy, inclusive development and customer relations. The initial notification was amended in November 2015 in order to expand the BRR requirements from the top 100 listed entities to the top 500 listed entities.
